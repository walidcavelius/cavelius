this website was made using hugo for the static website generation. it really is fast and easy-to-use, though i felt like the documentation could be a bit improved (update as of 2025, it was!)

the font used is [simsun](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/typography/font-list/simsun) by microsoft

i used github deployments to build with hugo and deploy the website on my free oracle server as soon as a change is pushed on the github.
