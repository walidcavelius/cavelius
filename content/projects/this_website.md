this website was made using hugo for the static website generation. it really is fast and easy-to-use, though i felt like the documentation could be a bit improved
i used github deployments to build with hugo and deploy the website on my free oracle server as soon as a change is pushed on the github.

(i know, the lastfm api key is hardcoded, i just felt lazy, i'll fix it asap)
